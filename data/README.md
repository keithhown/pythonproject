# Anatomy of a Blockbuster: Exploratory Analysis of Movies
This project takes a closer look at the world of cinema through the lens of data. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of movies, it investigates how financial performance, audience ratings, and other factors shape the landscape of the film industry.
Key aspects of the analysis include:
- **Distributions**: Examining the spread of budgets, revenues, profits, and ROI to understand common patterns and outliers.  
- **Trends over time**: Observing how the number of movies, average budgets, revenues, and audience ratings evolved year by year.  
- **Genres**: Identifying which genres dominate in terms of production volume and financial performance.  
- **Runtime categories**: Comparing average profit and ROI across different movie lengths.  
- **Correlation analysis**: Exploring relationships between key numerical variables to uncover potential insights.

The dataset is loaded and preprocessed using `load_and_clean_data.py`, ensuring clean and reliable data for the visualizations created with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
